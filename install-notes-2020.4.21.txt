To switch off USB bus power: sudo uhubctl -l 2 -a 0
To turn it back on: sudo uhubctl -l 2 -a 1

Needed to compile github.com/mvp/uhubctl from latest master as of 2020.4.20
to get this working. Just cloned into a /tmp folder, installed libusb per 
README.md build instructions, ran make, and sudo make install.
Uuhubctl package from apt-get was too old to work on Rpi4.

2020.4.21
For setup, generally followed Fruitnanny blog post from 2017 found at:
https://ivadim.github.io/2017-08-21-fruitnanny
Some deviations from the setup instructions there were necessary.
Those are detailed below as well as I can remember.
Also tried the docker setup method described more recently in
the fruitnanny github repo, but did not have any luck getting that
to work, and debugging docker containers is not my strong suit, so
switched back to the non-docker installation.

Deviations include:
The certificate location in the blog post does not match where
the janus and nginx config files in the latest repo are set to
look for them. These need to be put in the right spot, or both
will fail to start. Correct spot as of this writing is:
/etc/fruitnanny-ssl

Have to run "npm install" in /opt/fruitnanny to pull down
depedencies. This is not detailed in the blog post, and
isn't necessarily obvious to anyone who doesn't use nodejs
every day (like me).

For some reason, the plugins, transports, and events folders
in janus.jcfg are not correct from the repo. Needed to be
corrected in my installation to:
/usr/local/lib/janus/plugins
/usr/local/lib/janus/transports
/usr/local/lib/janus/events

This is not so much a problem with the blog post instructions
as it is a problem with the current state of the repo, and
may just be a problem with default configuration of my system
versus configuration of the person working on the repo.
